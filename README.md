# Challenge 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Task

This week's Challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## Screenshot

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
